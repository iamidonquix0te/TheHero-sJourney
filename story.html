            The village's gate only enters your sight long after night has fallen, and the gate has closed. A single guard stands near it, using his spear to support himself in his half-sleep.

Having called onto devouts of Trystin for healing before, you recognise the familiar tingling of their magic. The sensation of your wounds closing is a strange, somewhat painful one.<br><br> His work finished, he leaves you without bandages, your wounds having turned to scars. "They'll fade eventually, as long as you keep them moisturised." He rises from his chair before continuing : "that'll be a hundred and fifty golds."<br><br> In other words, a year of your salary as a mercenary.

                Rhain sighs and begins to take off his own armour. Aerona then climbs into the cart, laying down her own burdens.

                You don't catch Rhain's answer, covered as it is by the merchant's sudden exclamation : "We're good to go !" <br><br> Your cart begins to move as the driver motions for the horse to go. The cart in which Mabyn and Wooly sit lets you pass it so you may be first on the road ; the older woman waves at you as it does so, as if this were goodbye. The village, which you could still vaguely see in the distance, quickly disappears. One journey ends ; another begins.
